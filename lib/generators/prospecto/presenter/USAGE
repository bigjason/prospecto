Description:
    Generate a simple presenter class.

    The name can be anything you want, there is no direct correlation between a
    presenter and a single model, although there is often a correlation with the
    presenter and the controller.

Example:
    rails generate presenter User

    This will create:
        app/presenters/user_presenter.rb
        spec/presenters/user_presenter_spec.rb
