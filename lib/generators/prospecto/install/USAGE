Description:
    Generate a base ApplicationPresenter class.

    This is completely optional.  If an ApplicationPresenter is not found then
    not base class will be set on new presenters.

Example:
    rails generate prospecto:install

    This will create:
        app/presenters/application_presenter.rb
        spec/presenters/application_presenter_spec.rb
