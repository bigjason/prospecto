# Prospecto

*Simple rails presenter with an emphasis on just using ruby.*

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'prospecto'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prospecto

## Overview

There are 2 problems that prospecto was created to solve.

1. Views are hard and ineffective to test.
2. Code is often common between the output formats.

We feel that (our interpretation of) the presenter pattern is the answer to these problems. To be clear, you
do not need a library to implement the presenter pattern.  The purpose of prospecto is to provide some syntactic
sugar and structure.
